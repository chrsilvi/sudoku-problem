This is a coding practice exercise that a friend gave me:

"In some sudoku variants, you know you need a collection of digits from 1-9
that add to some number. Being sudoku, you can't reuse any digits in the sum.
So for example, you can add numbers to get 4 in two different ways: either a 4
by itself or a 1 and a 3. You can't do 2 and 2, since that's the same digit.

Write a program that can give all possible ways to add sudoku digits to yield
some total. Note that any number above 45 is impossible. Concepts that might
help are sets and recursion. Fair warning that if you do solve this with
recursion, high-total sums might end up being very slow."

This repo is more a journal of me trying to solve this problem and what
steps I'm talking to solve the problem. I was unfamiliar with recursion before
starting this problem.
